This misfortune keeps repeating itself: It's 9pm and you're happily working away in your dark themed code editor when you need to look something up. So you fire up your dark themed web browser from your dark themed OS desktop and do a search in your dark themed search page. Then, absent-mindedly, you click a search result that takes you to Wikipedia where you have your retinas burned out by the whitest website on the entire internet.

I remember reading that one of the Wikipedia founders had refused to entertain adding a dark mode to the site. I wish some wealthy benefactor would make further funding conditional on them adding it. In the meantime, I need a browser extension that prevents me from opening Wikipedia after 7pm.

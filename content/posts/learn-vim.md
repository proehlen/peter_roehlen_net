At work, I alternately have to use VS Code which does have vim key bindings and Eclipse which doesn’t. So I’ve been switching between the two for over a year and get reminded daily that I am, without exaggeration, 2x to 10x faster in VS Code. Not because of the editor, but because I can use vim mode in it.

Seriously, learn vim even if you don’t use end up using the vim editor. You need to commit to it and it will really suck for a week or two but it’s like the difference between “hunt and peck” and touch typing for the productivity boost it will give you. That’s assuming you already touch type that is; if not, you should learn that first anyway.

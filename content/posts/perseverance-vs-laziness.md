15 minutes before I was due to start work this morning, I finally got some code working in a personal project that Iâ€™d been wrestling with for hours over the weekend.

It got me thinking that it would be difficult to estimate which was a more important trait to human progress: bloody minded perseverance or laziness. The latter of which is often the impetus for finding a different/better way.

The ability to customize everything in Linux is like crack after coming from Windows where a mountain of small irritants added up to an dull ache in balls that I didn’t have the power to do anything about it.

Don’t like the way something looks? Change it. Don’t like the way something else behaves? Change that. Can’t change it via a gui setting? Hack some config file or write a script to do it. Can’t do that? Fork the code and change it there (I haven’t done that yet but I’ve been tempted). You can lose hours making everything just so when it was okay enough to begin with.

I must stop now.

Bloody hell. I thought I'd learn me some [Elixir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_(programming_language)) this weekend. The second example you type in from their "Getting Started" page is this:

```
iex> "hello" <> " world"
"hello world"
```

`<>` is the string concatenation operator? Wtf? That's the inequality operator in at least 4 languages including SQL.

Sorry, but this relationship isn't going to work out. Maybe show people your good side before you introduce them to your nutty family and confess you were a serial arsonist in your teens.
